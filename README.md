### Hey, it's me! 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a NodeJS project called Markdown-Links that will allow you to run it through all of your .md files to check which links are still working and which are broken(cool, uh?)!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot about NodeJS itself, along with regEx, CLI, CommonJS Modules, package.json, http and a lot more!
- 👨🏿‍💻I'm a Web Developer Student at Laboratoria.
